### Objective

Your challenge is to build the job listing page shown in the images in the "design" folder. You should demonstrate a good understanding of the various tools in our tech stack (detailed below), and stick as closely as possible to the designs. 

### Tech Stack

 - TypeScript
 - Angular
 - SCSS
 - RxJS
 - Angular Material (optional)

This repository is already set up with the above tech stack (in the jobs-list folder). While we would prefer that you use this stack, if you would feel much more comfortable using another library or framework, feel free to do so. 

### Specification

Use the [data.json](./data.json) file to load the data via the HttpClient and then dynamically render the content. 

Clicking one of the labels on the right hand side of a job card (shown in the active-states.jpg design) should add that label as a filter in the white bar at the top. The list should only display job cards that contain all the selected filters.

### Evaluation Criteria

 - Completeness
 - Adherence to the design
 - Code neatness, understandability and maintainability 
 - Use of TypeScript best practice
 - Use of Angular best practice
 - Use of reusable components where appropriate
 - Bonus points for strong RxJS usage

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
